I researched different AI agent projects and compared healthcare and cybersecurity use cases.
After understanding real-world impact, I decided to build an Incident Response Intelligence Agent because cybersecurity incidents are common, critical, and require correct step-by-step decisions.

I designed an AI assistant that:

- Understands a security problem

- Asks follow-up questions instead of guessing

- Decides how serious the issue is

- Guides the user with clear, safe actions

- Keeps a record of the incident
